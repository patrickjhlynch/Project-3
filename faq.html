				<h4>What is a normie?</h4>
				<p>
					Being an authority on normies, nqtest.com defines them as<br>
					<h5>
						A normal person who views themselves as different - but in reality is just the same as everyone else. Someone who knowingly or unknowingly embraces the mainstream - a basic person. Utterly irrelevant humans, normies can be easily identified and sniffed out by their taste in memes.
					</h5>

				</p>
				<h4>What makes you qualified to set the criteria for this quiz?</h4>
				<p>
					Nothing really. I think I have good taste in memes, but so does everybody. I'm aware enough to know I'm ahead of the masses by a fair margin, but if you feel that the test isn't up to standard, feel free to head to the Submit page and give me suggestions on how to improve the questions.
